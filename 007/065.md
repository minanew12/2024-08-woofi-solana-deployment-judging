# When withdrawing, the check that balance is enough for unclaimed fees is wrong

### Summary

When withdrawing, the check that there is enough [balance](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/util/token.rs#L12-L14) for unclaimed fees is wrong. It does not prevent withdrawing funds from the token vault so there is enough balance for unclaimed fees. 

Since the [check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/instructions/admin/deposit_withdraw.rs#L74) is done before the withdrawal and not after, funds can be withdrawn so that there will not be enough for unclaimed fees.

A pool can have a token vault balance that is lower than the sum of the pool reserve and unclaimed fees due to the [`incase_token_got_stuck`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/lib.rs#L203-L205) instruction.

### Root Cause

In [`token.rs:12-14`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/util/token.rs#L12-L14), the quote pool's vault is checked that it has enough balance for unclaimed fees. 
```rust
  (token_vault.amount as u128)
      .checked_sub(woopool.unclaimed_fee)
      .ok_or(ErrorCode::ReserveLessThanFee)?
```

However, the check is done [before withdrawal](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/instructions/admin/deposit_withdraw.rs#L74) and it does not account for the withdrawal amount. 
```rust
  let _balance_before = balance(woopool, token_vault)?;
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Pool owner has deducted funds using [`incase_token_got_stuck`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/lib.rs#L203-L205).

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Since the Pool owner has deducted funds with `incase_token_got_stuck`, the Pool now has a token vault balance of 100, 100 pool reserves, and 20 unclaimed fees.
2. The Pool owner [`withdraws`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/instructions/admin/deposit_withdraw.rs#L69) 100 tokens and this is not prevented since the check that balance is enough for unclaimed funds is insufficient.

### Impact

If the Pool owner wants to withdraw without regard for unclaimed fees and reserves, they can always use `incase_token_got_stuck`. All withdrawals via `withdraw` should ensure enough vault funds for at least the unclaimed fees. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider using the `_balance_before` in the [check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/instructions/admin/deposit_withdraw.rs#L76-L79) for enough balance when withdrawing. 

```diff
  require!(
-      woopool.reserve >= amount && token_vault.amount as u128 >= amount,
+     woopool.reserve >= amount && _balance_before as u128 >= amount,
      ErrorCode::NotEnoughBalance
  );
```
