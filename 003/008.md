# wo_price_in_bound has incorrect check implementation

## Summary

wo_price_in_bound has an incorrect condition statement that can make it return an incorrect value.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the current implementation of the `wo_price_in_bound`, the protocol uses the following check:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/instructions/get_price.rs#L78-80
```solidity
 let wo_price_in_bound = clo_price != 0
        && ((clo_price * (ONE_E18_U128 - bound)) / ONE_E18_U128 <= wo_price
            && wo_price <= (clo_price * (ONE_E18_U128 + bound)) / ONE_E18_U128);
```

First, we check if the `clo_price != 0` but this is incorrect way to handle it and should be done like it's introduced in the EVM implementation of the contracts:

https://github.com/woonetwork/woofi_swap_smart_contracts/blob/main/contracts/WooracleV2.sol#L202-203
```solidity
    bool checkWoBound = cloPrice == 0 ||
     (cloPrice.mulFloor(1e18 - bound) <= woPrice && woPrice <= cloPrice.mulCeil(1e18 + bound));
```

This check assures whether the derived `clo_price` reflects not feasible value or not and if so, this would make `checkWoBound` automatically set to `true` as we don't fetch zero-valued `clo_price`. But, in the current functionality, we check if the `clo_price != 0` and the `wo_price` are in bounds which is not a proper way to do it. 


## Impact

The current functionality for the contract does not ensure compatibility with the EVM implementation and does not perform correct checks of the prices that will result in a derived value being different from reality.

## Recommendation

Change the check to make sure `clo_price != 0` and if so, make `wo_price_in_bound` set to true.
