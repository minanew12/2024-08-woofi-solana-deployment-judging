# Fallback oracle is not used if the wo_price is not feasible and is not in bounds

## Summary

Currently the `price_out` is set to the `wo_price` only if it's feasible and within the bounds. However, if it's not, `price_out` is mistakenly set to 0 instead of using the `clo_price`.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the current implementation, we set `price_out` in the following way:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/instructions/get_price.rs#L84-90
```solidity
 if wo_feasible && wo_price_in_bound {
        price_out = wo_price;
        feasible_out = true;
    } else {
        price_out = 0;
        feasible_out = false;
    }
```
So if the `wo_feasible` and `wo_price_in_bound` are set to false, `price_out` is set to 0 and `feasible_out` is automatically set to `false` which is not an expected behavior as it has to be set to the `clo_price` instead as Pyth network is the fallback oracle:

https://github.com/woonetwork/woofi_swap_smart_contracts/blob/main/contracts/WooracleV2.sol#L205-211
```solidity
 if (checkWoFeasible && checkWoBound) {
            priceOut = woPrice;
            priceTimestamp = woPriceTimestamp;
        } else {
            priceOut = cloPrice;
            priceTimestamp = cloPriceTimestamp;
        }
``` 
The above implementation is from the EVM version of the contract. However, it uses Chainlink instead of Pyth network but the logic is the same.

## Impact

The price is incorrectly set to 0 instead of the price from the fallback oracle if the wooracle is not feasible.

## Recommendation

Set `price_out` to the `clo_price` in the else-statement. Moreover, it should be checked whether the `price_out`  != 0 and if not, set `feasible_out` to `true`. Otherwise, set to `false`.
