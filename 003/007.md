# Incorrect checking of the feasible wo_price

## Summary

Currently when getting the price of the asset from the oracle, `wo_feasible` is not verified correctly.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the current implementation, we check if the price is feasible the following way:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/instructions/get_price.rs#L77
```solidity
   let wo_feasible = clo_price != 0 && now <= (wo_timestamp + oracle.stale_duration);
```

The problem is that `clo_price` is the price that's derived from the Pyth network and `wo_price` is the price is derived from the wooracle. However, the check above makes sure that the `clo_price` != 0 when in reality it `wo_price` that should be checked. Additionally, the correct check can be seen in the EVM implementation of the contracts:

https://github.com/woonetwork/woofi_swap_smart_contracts/blob/main/contracts/WooracleV2.sol#L201
```solidity
bool checkWoFeasible = woPrice != 0 && block.timestamp <= (woPriceTimestamp + staleDuration);
```

This can lead to a situation where price of wooracle is not checked incorrectly and the check may return incorrect result affecting the final price that's fetched.

## Impact

`wo_feasible` can return incorrect results as `clo_price` is the price that's checked.

## Code Snippet

## Recommendation

Implement the following check:

```solidity
   let wo_feasible = wo_price != 0 && now <= (wo_timestamp + oracle.stale_duration);
```
