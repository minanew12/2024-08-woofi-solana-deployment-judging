# The implementation of `get_price_impl` is incorrect.

## Summary
The logic for retrieving the price is incorrect, resulting in fetching the wrong price.
## Vulnerability Detail
Here is the code logic for retrieving the price from the oracle:

```plaintext
when woFeasible && priceWithinBound     -> woPrice, feasible
when woFeasible && !priceWithinBound    -> woPrice, infeasible
when !woFeasible && clo_preferred       -> cloPrice, feasible
when !woFeasible && !clo_preferred      -> cloPrice, infeasible
```

We can see that the EVM implementation is correct. [Reference link](https://github.com/woonetwork/WooPoolV2/blob/36fce46c93f3043d7c08873323088432c29754f8/contracts/wooracle/WooracleV2.sol#L212-L240). However, when we look at the `get_price_impl` logic:

```rust
let wo_feasible = clo_price != 0 && now <= (wo_timestamp + oracle.stale_duration);
```

This implementation is incorrect. The `clo_price` is fetched from Pyth, and the value of `wo_feasible` should represent the state stored in the oracle account. As a result, the boolean `wo_feasible` is incorrect, leading to the protocol fetching the wrong price. 
This is the correct implementation of `isWoFeasible` in the EVM:
```solidity
    function isWoFeasible(address base) external view override returns (bool) {
        return infos[base].price != 0 && block.timestamp <= (timestamp + staleDuration);
    }
```
Additionally, the logic here is also incorrect:

```rust
if wo_feasible && wo_price_in_bound {
    price_out = wo_price;
    feasible_out = true;
} else {
    price_out = 0;
    feasible_out = false;
}
```

If `wo_feasible` is true and `wo_price_in_bound` is false, `price_out` should be `wo_price`, not 0.

## Impact
The logic for retrieving the price is incorrect, resulting in fetching the wrong price.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to refactor this logic according to the EVM implementation.
