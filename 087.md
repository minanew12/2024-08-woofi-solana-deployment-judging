# DEFAULT_STALE_DURATION causing swap to revert

## Summary
By the wooracle’s default values, if a `wooracle.post_price` is not triggered every atleast 120 seconds, the `swap` function will be reverting when trying to fetch the oracle price.

## Vulnerability Detail
The wooracle’s default `stale_duration` is 120 seconds, if the `wo_timestamp + oracle.stale_duration` is greater than the current timestamp, the swap reverts. 
The `wo_timestamp` is equal to `oracle.updated_at` which is updated only at `post_price` .
Which means if `post_price` is not executed every 120 seconds by the `swap` , subsequent `swap` calls which require the oracle’s price, will be reverting.

## Impact
Any `swap` that requires the affected wooracle’s price, will be reverting.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The first step is to change the `DEFAULT_STALE_DURATION` in a value that is not too short to avoid `swap` calls getting reverted. Afterwards, the protocol needs to ensure that no stale prices are present.
