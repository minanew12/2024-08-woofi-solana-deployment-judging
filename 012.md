# Spread is not updated for base tokens when performing base to base swap

## Summary

Currently the function `handler()` is supposed to update the spread and the state afterwards of both base tokens when performing base to base swap. However, it does not do it.

## Vulnerability Detail

Take a look at how state updates are made inside of `handler()` function:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/instructions/swap.rs#L135-139
```solidity
 if woopool_from.token_mint != woopool_from.quote_token_mint {
        let state_from =
            get_price::get_state_impl(wooracle_from, price_update_from, quote_price_update)?;

        let (_quote_amount, new_base_price) = swap_math::calc_quote_amount_sell_base(
            from_amount,
            woopool_from,
            &decimals_from,
            &state_from,
        )?;

        wooracle_from.post_price(new_base_price)?;

        quote_amount = _quote_amount;
    }
```

However, in the EVM implementation of the contracts, it's done the following way:

https://github.com/woonetwork/WooPoolV2/blob/main/contracts/WooPPV2.sol#L545-558
```solidity
    {
            uint64 spread = _maxUInt64(state1.spread, state2.spread) / 2;
            uint16 feeRate = _maxUInt16(tokenInfos[baseToken1].feeRate, tokenInfos[baseToken2].feeRate);

            state1.spread = spread;
            state2.spread = spread;

            uint256 newBase1Price;
            (quoteAmount, newBase1Price) = _calcQuoteAmountSellBase(baseToken1, base1Amount, state1);
            IWooracleV2_2(wooracle).postPrice(baseToken1, uint128(newBase1Price));
            // console.log('Post new base1 price:', newBase1Price, newBase1Price/1e8);

            swapFee = (quoteAmount * feeRate) / 1e5;
        }
```

As you can see from code snippets above, in the first case we don't take spread into account at all. This results in an incorrect `spread` value being used when calculating amount for both operations (selling base to quote, selling quote to base) as we take not the average spread as in the EVM version but the spread of the base token:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/instructions/get_price.rs#L115
```solidity
        spread: oracle.spread;
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/util/swap_math.rs#L54-58
```solidity
let calc_b: u128 = ONE_E18_U128
        .checked_sub(gamma)
        .unwrap()
        .checked_sub(state.spread as u128)
        .unwrap();

```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/util/swap_math.rs#L104-108

```solidity
let calc_c: u128 = ONE_E18_U128
        .checked_sub(gamma)
        .unwrap()
        .checked_sub(state.spread as u128)
        .unwrap();
```

As the protocol states for the EVM and Solana contracts to be identical, this can be also considered as a deviation from the spec.

## Impact

Incorrect spread being used may affect base amount calculation.

## Recommendation

Calculate the average spread of the base token 1 and base token 2 by fetching their corresponding states from the oracle and use this spread in calculation of base amount in `swap_math`.
