# _quote_amount is always calculated with outdated price potentially leading to loss of funds

## Summary
Wooracle uses prices that were calculated using the previous call of Pyth’s oracle.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `swap.rs` when `token_mint` is not equal to `quote_token_mint` , the function `get_price::get_state_impl` is called to fetch the price from the wooracle. Although, instead of returning the price fetched from the Pyth’s oracle, the function checks whether the fetched price is within set bounds of the price that was manually set in wooracle’s price variable.

Then the price is updated using the wooracle’s price variable and their formula, resulting again in a price that is not equal to the oracle’s price.

## Impact
Since the wooracle’s price doesn’t match the Pyth’s price, it will lead to a situation where either legit users are getting worse prices (loss of funds) or malicious users extracting value from the pools (arbitrage) by buying when the wooracle’s price is off the Pyth’s oracle price.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Instead of checking whether the wooracle.price is within the bounds set in the wooracle, make use of the fetched price.
