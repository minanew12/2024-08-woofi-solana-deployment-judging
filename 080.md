# Potential for Unauthorized Rebate Adjustments in `AddSubRebate`

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `AddSubRebate` instruction, any `authority` that is either the `rebate_manager.authority` or an `admin_authority` can add or subtract pending rebates from any `RebateInfo` account:

```rust
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct AddSubRebate<'info> {
    pub authority: Signer<'info>,

    // Other accounts...

    #[account(mut,
        has_one = rebate_manager,
        has_one = rebate_authority,
    )]
    pub rebate_info: Account<'info, RebateInfo>,
}
```

Since `rebate_authority` is an unchecked account and can be any account, an admin could potentially manipulate the `pending_rebate` of any `RebateInfo`, including their own, leading to unauthorized fund claims.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Introduce additional constraints or checks to ensure that only authorized actions can be taken on a `RebateInfo`. For example, you might require that only the `rebate_manager.authority` (not `admin_authority`) can adjust rebates, or you might include logic to prevent admins from adjusting rebates for accounts they control.
