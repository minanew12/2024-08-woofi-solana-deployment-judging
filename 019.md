# Rebate_to account not validated during Swapping

### Summary

There is a missing check to the rebate account when swapping is performed, hence any account could be passed into the rebate account.

### Root Cause

[rebate_to](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/instructions/swap.rs#L93) account not validated

### Internal pre-conditions

Any user can call this instruction and pass any account as the `rebate_to` account



### Attack Path

Calling the `swap` instruction and passing any account to the `rebate_to` account  is enough to trigger this functionality

### Impact

There is little impact as these account is only emitted through an event but this emitted event could be used to trick event listeners in the case of an actual attack scenario.

### PoC

Passing any account into the `rebate_to` account when the `swap` instruction is called

### Mitigation

Validate `rebate_to` account by performing the following steps

Step 1
Add
```rust
[dependencies.rebate_manager]
path = "../rebate_manager"
```
to [Cargo.toml](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/Cargo.toml)

Step 2
Make the state [module](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/rebate_manager/src/lib.rs#L36) public
`pub mod state;`

Step 3
Verify `rebate_to` account is owned by the `rebate_manager` program and add other custom checks
`    rebate_to: Account<'info, rebate_manager::state::rebate_info::RebateInfo>,
` in [`swap.rs`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/instructions/swap.rs#L93)
