# User will use external accounts for bypassing check in programs

### Summary

In the current implementation, multiple instructions make the assumption that accounts are owned by the current program (so are trusted) but they are not. This allows user to provide external accounts to bypass checks.

### Root Cause

- Lack of seeds constraint every time `wooconfig` is used (for example: [`create_wooracle.rs#L44`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/instructions/admin/create_wooracle.rs#L44))

Other occurences in [`claim_fee.rs`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/instructions/admin/claim_fee.rs), [`create_pool.rs#L9`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/instructions/admin/create_pool.rs#L9), [`deposit_withdraw.rs#L9`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/instructions/admin/deposit_withdraw.rs#L9), and everywhere else in the codebase.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User creates a wooconfig account owned by himself
2. User uses this wooconfig account through the WooFi instructions to bypass checks

### Impact

Multiple checks are bypassed, including access control checks.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Every time `wooconfig` is expected, ensure that the account is the correct PDA.

For example, in the `CreateWooracle` structure, it gives:

```rust
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct CreateWooracle<'info> {
    #[account(
        seeds = [
          WOOCONFIG_SEED.as_bytes(),
        ],
        bump)]
    pub wooconfig: Box<Account<'info, WooConfig>>,
```
