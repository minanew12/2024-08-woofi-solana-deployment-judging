# Quote pools are expected to have same base token and quote token but this is not enforced in swaps

### Summary

The missing [constraint](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/instructions/swap.rs#L79-L84) that enforces quote pools should have the same base and quote token will cause swap fees to be deducted from non-quote pools.

By design, [quote pools](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/util/token.rs#L11-L15) are pools with the same base and quote token. The development team has confirmed this. All [swap fees](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/instructions/swap.rs#L192-L194) should come from quote pools.  

```rust
  // record fee into account
  woopool_quote.sub_reserve(swap_fee).unwrap();
  woopool_quote.add_unclaimed_fee(swap_fee).unwrap();
```

### Root Cause

In [`swap.rs:79-84`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/instructions/swap.rs#L79-L84), there is no constraint that enforces that the pool used as the quote pool has the same base token and quote token. 

```rust
  #[account(mut,
      has_one = wooconfig,
      constraint = woopool_quote.token_mint == woopool_from.quote_token_mint,
      constraint = woopool_quote.authority == woopool_from.authority,
  )]
  woopool_quote: Box<Account<'info, WooPool>>,
```

This means that non-quote pools can be used as quote pools during [swaps](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/instructions/swap.rs#L192-L194) and swap fees will be deducted from these. 
```rust
  // record fee into account
  woopool_quote.sub_reserve(swap_fee).unwrap();
  woopool_quote.add_unclaimed_fee(swap_fee).unwrap();
```

### Attack Path

1. Anyone can execute swaps by invoking the [`swap`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/lib.rs#L183-L185) instruction and passing a non-quote pool as a `woopool_quote`. The [constraints](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/instructions/swap.rs#L79-L84) will allow it as long as the `woopool_quote`'s base token is the same as the `woopool_from`'s quote token and the pools have the same owners. 

### Impact

Swap fees can be deducted from non-quote pools instead of quote pools only.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider adding a [constraint](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/instructions/swap.rs#L79-L84) that enforces that the quote pool is a pool with the same base and quote token.
