# Incorrect implementation of `query` function

### Summary

Because of an incorrect condition, the `query` function will succeed and the `swap` function would fail for same parameters.

The `query` function is intended to be a **view** form of  `swap`. The `query` returns the output amounts without doing the actual swap and the function should fail if the swap is not possible.

The `query` function ensures the `woopool_to` has enough reserves for the out amount and the swap fee:

The used require conditions will incorrectly pass in case the swap is from Base-to-Quote swap. In the Base-to-Quote swap, the `woopool_to` and the `woopool_quote` will be same. As a result, the swap `fee` is also deducted from the `woopool_to`.

However, the `query` ensures that 
1. `woopool_to` has enough reserves for `to_amount` (`woopool_to.reserve >= to_amount`)
2. `woopool_quote` has enough reserves for fees (`woopool_quote.reserve >= swap_fee`)

These checks are done separately. When the `woopool_to`, `woopool_quote` are same, it is possible that

`woopool_to.reserve >= to_amount`,  `woopool_to.reserve >= swap_fee` but `woopool_to.reserve < to_amount + swap_fee`.

In this case, the query function succeeds even when it should not.

### Root Cause

Incorrect condition for checking whether the reserves of the `woopool_to` are sufficient to cover for to_amount and swap_fee:

### Attack Path

1. Alice intends swap from SOL to USDC.
2. `woopool_from = (SOL, USDC)`, `woopool_to = (USDC, USDC)`, ` woopool_quote = (USDC, USDC)` and `woopool_to == woopool_quote`.
3. `woopool_from` has 2 SOL in reserve and `woopool_to` has `130` USDC.
4. Wooracle price is `1 SOL = 125 USDC`
5. Alice calls query function to swap `1` SOL. The `to_amount = 125 USDC` and `swap_fee = 15 USDC`.
6. The query function succeeds even when the `woopool_to.reserve == 130 USDC < 125 + 15 USDC`.


### Impact

Incorrect implementation of core functionality: Query incorrectly succeeds when it should not.
