# Gamma is rounded down, against the protocol, in calc_quote_amount_sell_base

### Summary

The amount of quote tokens for a given amount of base tokens is calculated using the following formula:

```solidity
gamma = k * price * base_amount
quoteAmount = base_amount * price * (1 - k * base_amount * price - oracle.spread)

quoteAmount = base_amount * price * (1 - gamma - spread).
```

The trade is executed at the price

```solidity
executedPrice = price * (1 - gamma - spread).
```

if gamma is less, then the trade is executed at a better price for the user and vice versa. As a result, the computation of gamma should **round-up** to favor the protocol. Rounding-down the computation favors the user instead of the protocol.

This is particularly problematic for the Solana deployment because single operation in Solidity is divided into multiple operations in Solana, as a result, increasing the rounding error.

The computation of gamma is divided into two operations. The rounding error in the calculation of `gamma_calc_a` gets multiplied by the `coeff` in #L33 resulting in increased rounding error.

 

### Root Cause

The `swap_math::calc_quote_amount_sell_base` function rounds down the value of `gamma` favouring the user instead of the protocol. The rounding error is significantly increased because of divison of the operation:

The [Solidity](https://github.com/woonetwork/WooPoolV2/blob/36fce46c93f3043d7c08873323088432c29754f8/contracts/WooPPV2.sol#L620)  version computes the gamma in a single operation:
```solidity
            gamma = (baseAmount * state.price * state.coeff) / decs.priceDec / decs.baseDec;
```

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

User gets more quote tokens then they should on every swap because of rounding-down on `gamma`. The loss from rounding-down adds up to a significant value for the protocol LPs.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update the `calc_quote_amount_sell_base` function to round-up the computation of gamma.
