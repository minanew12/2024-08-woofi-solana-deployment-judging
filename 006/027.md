# Querying for the swap amounts does not account for the swap fee when the quote and base token are the same in the from Pool

### Summary

The [query](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/lib.rs#L175-L181) instruction will not [check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/instructions/query.rs#L118-L123) if the quote pool has enough funds to handle the swap fee when the from-pool has the same base and quote token.

```rust
  if woopool_from.token_mint != woopool_from.quote_token_mint {
      require!(
          woopool_quote.reserve >= swap_fee && quote_token_vault.amount as u128 >= swap_fee,
          ErrorCode::NotEnoughOut
      );
  }
```

However, the swap instruction always checks that the quote pool has enough funds with [`sub_reserve()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/instructions/swap.rs#L193). This discrepancy in behavior between `query()` and `swap()` will cause some swaps to fail when using a from-pool that has only 1 token. `query()` will be used by swappers as a reference for the expected output amount given an input amount.

### Root Cause

In [`query.rs:118-123`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/instructions/query.rs#L118-L123), the check if the reserve has enough funds for the swap fee is not done when the from-pool has the same base and quote token.

```rust
  if woopool_from.token_mint != woopool_from.quote_token_mint {
      require!(
          woopool_quote.reserve >= swap_fee && quote_token_vault.amount as u128 >= swap_fee,
          ErrorCode::NotEnoughOut
      );
  }
```

Although this same [check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/instructions/swap.rs#L154-L159) exists in `swap()`, the quote pool is still implicitly checked if it has enough funds for the swap fee through [`sub_reserve()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/instructions/swap.rs#L193).

ref: [`sub_reserve()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/state/woopool.rs#L137-L145)
```rust
  pub fn sub_reserve(&mut self, amount: u128) -> Result<()> {
      if amount > self.reserve {
          return Err(ErrorCode::ReserveNotEnough.into());
      }

      self.reserve -= amount;

      Ok(())
  }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The quote pool does not have enough reserves for a swap fee.

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. A swapper gets the expected out amount given an input amount by calling the [`query()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/lib.rs#L175-L181) instruction off-chain before swapping. 
2. The swapper executes the [`swap()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/lib.rs#L183-L185) with the same input amount but it fails because there aren't enough reserves in the quote pool.

### Impact

When the quote pool has low reserves, some swaps will unexpectedly fail due to the difference in behavior of `query()` and `swap()`.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider modifying the [`query()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/instructions/query.rs#L118-L123) to always check whether the reserve and token vault have enough funds to handle the swap fee. This makes the behavior match the `swap()` instruction.
