# Fees are inconsistently charged if the price direction quote -> base and base -> quote

## Summary

The protocol charges fees at the moment on every swap. The problem is that depending on the direction of the swap this amount may differ resulting in a loss of potential slippage funds by the protocol (or taking excessive funds making some users paying more).

## Vulnerability Detail

At the moment  the fees are taken from the `quote_amount`:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/instructions/swap.rs#L151
```solidity
 let swap_fee = checked_mul_div_round_up(quote_amount, fee_rate as u128, ONE_E5_U128)?;
```

The problem is that in one case it's taken from the initial amount and in the other after performing the first swap:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/instructions/swap.rs#L148
```solidity
  quote_amount = _quote_amount;
```

Here the fees are taking after selling base token to the quote token.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/instructions/swap.rs#L134
```solidity
 let mut quote_amount = from_amount;
```

And here it's taken from the initial `from_amount` meaning it has a certain value every time. So if the direction of the swap is quote -> base (selling the quote token and getting the base token) the first if-statement will be skipped and we'll take the fees from the initial `from_amount`. In the second case, the swap can be subjected to MEV attacks and therefore every time the protocol may lose some fees due to the slippage.

## Impact

The protocol will lose fee money due to the inconsistent fee charge.

## Recommendation

Take fees on the initial amount to avoid slippage impact.
