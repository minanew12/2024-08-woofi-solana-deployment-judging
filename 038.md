# Missing access control in the create_config instruction

## Summary

At the moment `create_config()` instruction misses access control meaning anybody can basically create a new config which is an unexpected behavior.

## Vulnerability Detail

Let's take a look at the `CreateConfig` struct:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/instructions/admin/create_config.rs#L6-22
```solidity
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct CreateConfig<'info> {
    #[account(mut)]
    pub authority: Signer<'info>,

    #[account(
        init,
        payer = authority,
        space = 8 + WooConfig::INIT_SPACE,
        seeds = [
          WOOCONFIG_SEED.as_bytes(),
        ],
        bump)]
    pub wooconfig: Box<Account<'info, WooConfig>>,

    pub system_program: Program<'info, System>,
}
```

As you can see, `authority` is not verified somehow (no constraints to make sure it's a trusted payer) meaning anybody can create a new config. As the `wooconfig` is one of the central admin instructions that will be widely used in the system, this issue will cause some serious consequences.

## Impact

Anybody can call admin instruction `handler()` function and set a new `wooconfig`.

## Code Snippet

Provided above.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Make sure that the authority is verified in the `create_config` instruction as it's done in other instructions by setting some constraints.
