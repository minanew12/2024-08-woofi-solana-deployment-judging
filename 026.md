# The calculation of `quote_amount` may result in discrepancies

## Summary
Failure to account for the spread results in discrepancies in the `quote_amount` calculation.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the Swap base-to-base operation, the EVM code includes the following calculation:

```solidity
uint64 spread = _maxUInt64(state1.spread, state2.spread) / 2;
```

This is the code link: [here](https://github.com/woonetwork/WooPoolV2/blob/36fce46c93f3043d7c08873323088432c29754f8/contracts/WooPPV2.sol#L546). The operation takes the maximum spread between two tokens and then divides it by 2.

However, this calculation is missing in the Solana codebase, which may result in discrepancies when calculating the `quote_amount`:

```rust
let calc_a: u128 = checked_mul_div(base_amount, state.price_out, decimals.price_dec as u128)?;
let calc_b: u128 = ONE_E18_U128
    .checked_sub(gamma)
    .unwrap()
    .checked_sub(state.spread as u128)
    .unwrap();
let calc_c = checked_mul_div(calc_a, calc_b, ONE_E18_U128)?;
let quote_amount = checked_mul_div(
    calc_c,
    decimals.quote_dec as u128,
    decimals.base_dec as u128,
)?;
```
## Impact
This omission may lead to incorrect `quote_amount` calculations.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to follow the EVM implementation:

```solidity
uint64 spread = _maxUInt64(state1.spread, state2.spread) / 2;
```
