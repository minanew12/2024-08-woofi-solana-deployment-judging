# Wooracle timestamp not updated on initialization

### Summary

The `updated_at` field in `wooracle` account data is not updated when the wooracle account is initialized.

### Root Cause

When the `create_wooracle` instruction is called, the `updated_at` field is not initialized as shown [below](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/instructions/admin/create_wooracle.rs#L112)

### Internal pre-conditions

The `create_wooracle` instruction is called which does not initialize the `updated_at` field.

The `get_price` instruction is called and it fails to get the appropriate price due to the constraint in [`get_price.rs`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/instructions/get_price.rs#L74-L77)

where
```rust
let now = Clock::get()?.unix_timestamp;
let wo_timestamp = oracle.updated_at;

now <= (wo_timestamp + oracle.stale_duration)
```


### Impact

This could lead to getting a wrong price balance(0) when trying to get the price or It could lead to DOS during swapping since `swap.rs` using the [`get_price_impl`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/instructions/swap.rs#L169) under the [hood](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/instructions/get_price.rs#L112).


### Mitigation

These can easily be prevented by adding 
`ctx.accounts.wooracle.update_now()?;` in [`create_wooracle.rs`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/instructions/admin/create_wooracle.rs#L112) to initialize the `updated_at` field in `wooracle` at iniitialization.
