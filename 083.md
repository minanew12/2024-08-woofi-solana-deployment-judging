# incase_token_got_stuck_handler does not update protocol state leading to corrupted state

## Summary
The function `incase_token_got_stuck_handler` does not properly update the pool’s state when transferring tokens from the pool to the admin, which results in corrupted state.
## Vulnerability Detail
When calling `deposit` , `withdraw` , `claim_fee` , `claim_fee_amount` , or `swap` the pool’s state is properly updated i.e. the `reserve` and `unclaimed_fee` variables are checked and increased or decreased.

This is not the case for the `incase_token_got_stuck_handler` function where there are no checks or updates to the state. Which leads to the rest of the functions to revert if the checks do not hold true.

E.g. when trying to swap amounts that the pool’s `reserve` says there is enough reserve to swap, but the token_vault’s `amount` is not sufficient.

## Impact
The pool’s core functionality will be unusable if `incase_token_got_stuck_handler` is used. The issue cannot be reversed since there is no mechanism to correct the corrupted pool state.

## Recommendation
Properly update the pool state’s `reserve` and `unclaimed_fee` so that the pool’s state is not corrupted, and trading may be resumed.
