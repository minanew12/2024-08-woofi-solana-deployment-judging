# Swap fees are only taken for the first swap

## Summary

Swap fees in the `handler()` function are only taken for the first swap but not for the second swap which is not an expected behavior.

## Vulnerability Detail

The current functionality of the `handler()` function that performs the swap takes fees the following way:

Let's say we have SOL / USDT and USDC (or ETH but it's not supported yet) / USDT pools and we perform a swap from SOL to USDC. The first swap is when we convert SOL to the quote token (USDT) and the second is when we swap USDT on USDC obtaining the final amount. Currently the fees are only taken on the first swap:

```solidity
 let swap_fee = checked_mul_div_round_up(quote_amount, fee_rate as u128, ONE_E5_U128)?;
```

But they're not taken on the second swap:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/instructions/swap.rs#L168-180
```solidity

 if woopool_to.token_mint != woopool_to.quote_token_mint {
        let state_to = get_price::get_state_impl(wooracle_to, price_update_to, quote_price_update)?;

        let (_to_amount, to_new_price) = swap_math::calc_base_amount_sell_quote(
            quote_amount,
            woopool_to,
            &decimals_to,
            &state_to,
        )?;
        wooracle_to.post_price(to_new_price)?;

        to_amount = _to_amount;
    }
```

In comparison, EVM implementation of the same functionality takes swap on both operations - when selling quote and when selling base:

https://github.com/woonetwork/WooPoolV2/blob/main/contracts/WooPPV2.sol#L453
```solidity
uint256 swapFee = (quoteAmount * tokenInfos[baseToken].feeRate) / 1e5;
```
https://github.com/woonetwork/WooPoolV2/blob/main/contracts/WooPPV2.sol#L492
```solidity
    uint256 swapFee = (quoteAmount * tokenInfos[baseToken].feeRate) / 1e5;
```

## Impact

The swap fees are not taken on the swap from the quote token to the `woopool_to.token_mint` (selling quote operation):

## Recommendation

Take the fee on the `_to_amount` after selling quote token.
