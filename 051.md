# Precision loss in `wooracle.rs`

### Summary

In `update_spread_for_new_price` and `update_spread_for_new_price_and_spread` during the calculation of the `anti_spread` value division is performed before multiplication which leads to precision loss because of truncation
 

### Root Cause

dividing before multiplication in [line 163](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/state/wooracle.rs#L163) and [line 196](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/state/wooracle.rs#L196)

### Internal pre-conditions

no

### External pre-conditions

no

### Attack Path

call update_spread_for_new_price_and_spread and update_spread_for_new_price

### Impact

Loss of precision due to truncation

### PoC

looking at the `update_spread_for_new_price` code below 
```rust
pub fn update_spread_for_new_price(&mut self, price: u128) -> Result<()> {
        let pre_s = self.spread;
        let pre_p = self.price;
        if pre_p == 0 || price == 0 || pre_s >= ONE_E18_U64 {
            // previous price or current price is 0, no action is needed
            return Ok(());
        }

        let max_p = max(price, pre_p);
        let min_p = min(price, pre_p);
        // let anti_spread = (ONE_E18_U128 * ONE_E18_U128 * min_price) / max_price / (ONE_E18_U128 - pre_spread as u128);
        let calc_a = checked_mul_div(ONE_E18_U128, min_p, max_p)?;
        //@audit division before multiplication and does not follow the formula format 
        let anti_s = checked_mul_div(
            ONE_E18_U128,
            calc_a,
            ONE_E18_U128.checked_sub(pre_s as u128).unwrap(),
        )?;
        if anti_s < ONE_E18_U128 {
            let new_s = ONE_E18_U128.checked_sub(anti_s).unwrap() as u64;
            if new_s > pre_s {
                self.update_spread(new_s)?;
            }
        }
        //note: when spread is gt ONE_E18_U128 spread is not updated |

        Ok(())
    }
```

we can see the [anti_spread](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/state/wooracle.rs#L161) comment which previews the formula used in calculating anti_spread. 
Again, we should be able to observe that in the formula all multiplications are performed before divisions, however when we come to the implementation of `anti_spread` i.e `anti_s`, the formula is modularized for easy implementation but this brought an issue that is in the first module `calc_a` division performed before it is multiplied in the `anti_s` which makes it lose precision.

this same case applies to [`update_spread_for_new_price_and_spread`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/state/wooracle.rs#L178-L200) too

### Mitigation

 multiplication before division to prevent truncation of values
