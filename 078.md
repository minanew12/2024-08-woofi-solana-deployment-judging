# Withdraw/Redeem functions can fail due to blocked USDT/USDC accounts

## Summary
Withdraw and redeem functions in smart contracts can fail if they involve transferring USDT, USDC, or other centralized stablecoins from blocked or blacklisted accounts. Both Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) are issued by centralized entities with the authority to freeze or blacklist addresses. When an account is blacklisted, any attempts to transfer these tokens from the blacklisted address will be blocked, causing the transaction to fail.

This issue can significantly impact decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, which rely on seamless token transfers for operations like withdrawals and redemptions. If a user's address or the contract itself gets blacklisted, users may be unable to withdraw their funds, leading to a loss of trust and potentially severe financial consequences.

## Vulnerability Detail
pub fn deposit(ctx: Context<DepositWithdraw>, amount: u128) -> Result<()> {
    let token_owner_account = &ctx.accounts.token_owner_account;
    let token_vault = &ctx.accounts.token_vault;
    let woopool = &mut ctx.accounts.woopool;

    let _balance_before = balance(woopool, token_vault)?;

    require!(
        token_owner_account.amount as u128 >= amount,
        ErrorCode::NotEnoughBalance
    );

    woopool.add_reserve(amount)?;

    transfer_from_owner_to_vault(
        &ctx.accounts.authority,
        token_owner_account,
        token_vault,
        &ctx.accounts.token_program,
        amount as u64,
    )?;

    emit!(DepositEvent {
        authority: ctx.accounts.authority.key(),
        token_mint: woopool.token_mint,
        deposit_amount: amount,
    });

    Ok(())
}
pub fn withdraw(ctx: Context<DepositWithdraw>, amount: u128) -> Result<()> {
    let token_owner_account = &ctx.accounts.token_owner_account;
    let token_vault = &ctx.accounts.token_vault;
    let woopool = &mut ctx.accounts.woopool;

    let _balance_before = balance(woopool, token_vault)?;

    require!(
        woopool.reserve >= amount && token_vault.amount as u128 >= amount,
        ErrorCode::NotEnoughBalance
    );

    woopool.sub_reserve(amount)?;

    transfer_from_vault_to_owner(
        woopool,
        token_vault,
        token_owner_account,
        &ctx.accounts.token_program,
        amount as u64,
    )?;

    emit!(WithdrawEvent {
        authority: ctx.accounts.authority.key(),
        token_mint: woopool.token_mint,
        withdraw_amount: amount,
    });

    Ok(())
}

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
A potential way to fix this issue is to allow users to specify an alternative address for the transfer to go to. However, the contract must still validate that the withdrawal amount is correctly debited from the msg.sender's balance to prevent any unauthorized transfers. This ensures that users cannot steal other users' assets by specifying different addresses.
