# Permit functionality cannot be properly used in the contract

## Summary

At the moment protocol requires for the signer of the tx to be the owner of the account where the tokens will be withdrawn
from. This disallows using permit functionality (including USDC permits) and disables any potential integrations with 
many protocols.

## Vulnerability Detail


Currently there is a following check:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/instructions/swap.rs#L37
```solidity
 constraint = token_owner_account_from.owner == payer.key(),
```

This creates a situation where permit functionality (including USDC permit functionality as it's one of the tokens marked in scope) cannot be used at all breaking integrations
with many protocols where smart contract will transfer and swap the funds instead of the user.

## Impact

Protocol will not be compatible with a huge variety of other protocols as it disables the opportunity to use permit functionality
for gasless transfers, for example.

## Code Snippet

Provided above.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Check for allowance of the from account to allow using permit functionality.
