# Dividing large swaps into smaller swaps does not update spread

### Summary

The WooFi team has updated the `wooracle` to update the spread for new price. This is a [fix](https://github.com/woonetwork/WooPoolV2/pull/116) for many issues reported in the past audits of WooFi Solodity .

1. Issue H-1 in [Sherlock audit](https://2563590922-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FqxL8pa5qcyp6gpHL7o0j%2Fuploads%2F2tPeeEzdPrMMRklWtqcF%2FWOOFI_Swap_Audit_Report.pdf?alt=media&token=9d213fad-94c9-4ee9-b2bf-27f4183fde9b)
2.  Issue 3.1 in [Zellic report](https://2563590922-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FqxL8pa5qcyp6gpHL7o0j%2Fuploads%2F2WY9iiASaJNI7VCEouwd%2FWOOFi%20Swap%20-%20Zellic%20Audit%20Report.pdf?alt=media&token=613fe3fc-c249-4c5d-84ca-5265a3660029)
3. Issue 3.6 in Zellic report

The fix is incomplete as user can divide the large swap into multiple smaller swaps such that the condition for updating the spread is not satisfied without any additional costs. 

### Vulnerability details

The new spread is calculated as 
```solidity
spread_new = 1 - (min_p/max_p) / (1-spread_old)
if spread_new > spread_old:
      wooracle.spread = spread_new
```

Consider the case of Base-to-Quote swap

- Gamma = G = B * p * k
- new price = p1 = p * (1 - G)
- Because 0 <= G < 1 => `p1 < p` and `min_p = p1`, `max_p` = `p`
- price_decrease = `p - p1`
- anti_s = l = (p1 / p) * (1 / (1-s))
- new_s = 1 - l


`spread` is update if `new_s > s`

Graphing the equations [here](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/updyfp30c8) with `x = B = number of base tokens swapped` without any decimals i.e If `x = 2` then that means 2 SOL are swapped not 2 lamports.

- The black graph is  the `y = new_s`, depends on `p1` which changes based on `x = B`
- Red graph is `y = s`, a constant graph
- Green line is price decrease `p1 - p` based on amount of tokens swapped.

The WooFi program only updates the spread if `new_s > s` i.e where "black graph" is above the "red graph". Its easy to see that price can be decreased significantly without affecting the spread.

In the example, chosen randomly, shown in the graph:

- p = 33.3
- c = 0.00052
- s = 0.047

The red and black graphs meet at x = 5.3 i.e User can swap upto 5.3 base tokens and not cause an update to the spread. The price decreased upon 5.3 tokens is `3`.


The User can repeat the process multiple times without additional costs because:

1. The transaction costs are very minimal on Solana
2. Dividing a large swap into smaller swaps is more profitable as shown in the issue M-2 in the [Sherlock report](https://2563590922-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FqxL8pa5qcyp6gpHL7o0j%2Fuploads%2F2tPeeEzdPrMMRklWtqcF%2FWOOFI_Swap_Audit_Report.pdf?alt=media&token=9d213fad-94c9-4ee9-b2bf-27f4183fde9b).
3. The swap fee is a percentage of the swapped amount and there's no fixed component in swap fee. Dividing the swap into smaller amounts does not increase swap fee.

This issue makes the implemented fix incomplete.


### Root Cause

1. The defined formula for updating spread depends only on ratio of previous price to the new price and the spread is **only** updated if that ratio results in spread greater than the current spread. The formula should be defined such that the spread is incremented with a value of continuous function based on the price ratio instead of the current formula which only results in updates for big jumps in prices.
2. Not having a fixed component in swap fee making the swaps of smaller amounts profitable

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Price manipulation has described in Issue H-1 of the Sherlock audit report. For the attack to be profitable Pyth price also needs to be inaccurate because of external conditions.

2. User can divide large swaps into smaller swaps. The net effect of amount swapped is same in both cases, however spread is not updated when smaller swaps are performed. This leads to loss of more amount to arbitage as described in Issue 3.1 of the zellic report.

3. Sandwich attack can be used as described in issue 3.6 of the Zellic report.

### Impact

Because WooFi simulates centralized exchange, one of invariants it needs to ensure is to update spread upon large swaps. The user can divide into smaller swaps without additional costs. As a result of which, the spread is not updated even after large amount is swapped.

Impact noted in Issue 3.1 of the Zellic report:

> Users who wish to do large swaps may see better execution if they break up their swap into smaller
swaps. Also, large swaps can cause the pool to lose an undue amount of value to arbitrage due to
an overestimation of how accurate the current recorded price is.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. Rewrite the formula for updating spread: Derive a continuous function based on the price change ratio and increment/decrement the spread using the result of this function.
2. Add a fixed component to the swap fee disincentivizing division of large swap into smaller swaps.
