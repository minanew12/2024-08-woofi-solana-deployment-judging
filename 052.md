# The protocol does not support token2022


## Summary

With the address `token::ID` set in `token_program`, `token_program` of `token2022` will not be supported.
Therefore, tokens that rely on `token2022_program` will not be supported.

## Vulnerability Detail

The address of `token_program` must be `token::ID`:

```rust
    #[account(address = token::ID)]
    pub token_program: Program<'info, Token>,
```
The problem is that the program id for `token2022` is TOKEN_2022_PROGRAM_ID.

If the new token relies on `token2022`, it will not be supported.

Although it currently only supports sol, usdt, and usdc, it cannot be added later when you want to support other `token2022`
