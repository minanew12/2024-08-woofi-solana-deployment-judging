# [med] Allowing admin_authority to create `RebateInfo` will create DoS for `ClaimRebateFee` instruction

### Summary

This issue is from `rebate_manager` program.
`CreateRebateInfo` instruction is allowing `admin_authority` also along with the `authority` to create the `RebateInfo`s. Meanwhile in `ClaimRebateFee` context, the rebate_info is verified with check `rebate_info.authority == rebate_manager.authority`. So the `RebateInfo`s created by `rebate_manager.admin_authority` wont pass this check, the respective users were effected as they can't claim the rebate.

### Root Cause

The root cause is contradiction between the
1. Allowing admin_authority to create `RebateInfo` using `CreateRebateInfo` instruction.
2. Checking `rebate_info.authority == rebate_manager.authority` in `ClaimRebateFee` instruction

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. If an RebateInfo was create by admin_authority.
2. The ClaimRebate instruciton fails for that RebateInfo

### Impact

DoS for the RebateInfos if they are created by the admin_authority.
