# deposit function redundant check that may lead to DOS

## Summary
In `deposit_withdraw.rs` the function `deposit `may revert due to the call to `balance`.

## Vulnerability Detail
The revert will be caused due to the unnecessary check to verify that the `token_vault.amount` is greater than `woopool.unclaimed_fee`, despite the fact that `token_vault.amount` will be increased within the `deposit` function. 

## Impact
Incorrect check within `deposit` leads to the function reverting.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Remove the incorrect check in the line `let _balance_before = balance(woopool, token_vault)?;` to avoid unintended reverts.
