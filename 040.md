# Swap function does not check `woopool_quote` is indeed a quote pool

### Summary

WooFi defines a quote pool has the pool which has `pool.token_mint == pool.quote_token_mint` i.e pool for (Q, Q) where Q is the quote token for a set of pools. 

The `swap` function does not check this condition for the `woopool_quote` account. It only checks that the `woopool_quote.token_mint == woopool_from.quote_token_mint`.

It is possible for a pool to exist for a pair (R, S) where R is the quote_token for some other pools X, Y, Z but for this pool R is the base token and S is the quote token.

The pool (R, S) is not the quote pool for X, Y, Z but can be used as quote pool in swaps between X, Y, Z. 

As a result, an user can call `swap` with (R, S) as the `woopool_quote` for a swap between (X, R), (Y, R) pools and when the swap function deducts the fee it will be deducted from a base pool instead of the quote pool (R, R).

### Root Cause

Missing check in the `swap` function for the `woopool_quote` account:

```woopool_quote.token_mint == woopool_quote.quote_token_mint```.

### Internal pre-conditions

There exists a pool which has a quote token as base token with a different quote token.

For example:

USDC is the quote token and there are pools for (SOL, USDC), (USDT, USDC), (USDC, USDC). SOL and USDT are base tokens. (USDC, USDC) is the quote pool for these pools. Fees should be deducted from the (USDC, USDC) pool when SOL is swapped to USDT.

The vulnerability requires that there exists a pool for (USDC, Q) pair. For this pool, USDC is a base token and Q is the quote token. hence is not a quote pool for the SOL, USDT pairs.


The code indicates of this possibility:

1. The account constraints for the swap function ensures the `woopool_from`, `woopool_to`, `wooracle_from, _to` all have same `quote_token_mint` as a protection from usage of swaps between pools with different quote tokens. This shows that there could be multiple quote tokens.

2. The seeds used for the rebate manager includes the `quote_token_mint` allowing for a different manager for each quote token

3. The use of quote token mint in the seeds of woopool further indicate this possibility

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

User performs the swap operation with the following parameters.
- woopool_from: (SOL, USDC)
- woopool_to: (USDT, USDC)
- woopool_quote: (USDC, Q), Q != USDC.

After the swap operation, the fees are deducted into a base pool (USDC, Q) instead of the quote pool (USDC, USDC) for the SOL, USDT pairs.

### Impact

Users can make fees to be deducted from a different pool than the intended pool essentially reducing the reserves for the base pool. 

Correct implementation of claim fees disallows claiming the fees from a base pool. In the current implementation, `balance` function is called before the transfer instead of after. Correcting the function would increase the impact of this issue.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add `woopool_quote.token_mint == wooool_quote.quote_toke_mint` check in the swap function.
