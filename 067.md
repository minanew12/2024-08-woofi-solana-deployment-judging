# amount  can be overflowed in deposit and withdraw.

## Summary
wrong  implemented of amount in deposit and withdraw as we are using u128 to define the amount but when we are calling the transfer_from_owner_to_vault function we are using u64. if amount is greater than u64.max then then  we will be getting wrong amount.
## Vulnerability Detail
@>>pub fn deposit(ctx: Context<DepositWithdraw>, amount: u128) -> Result<()> {
    let token_owner_account = &ctx.accounts.token_owner_account;
    let token_vault = &ctx.accounts.token_vault;

    require!(
        token_owner_account.amount as u128 >= amount,
        ErrorCode::NotEnoughBalance
    );

@>>    transfer_from_owner_to_vault(
        &ctx.accounts.authority,
        token_owner_account,
        token_vault,
        &ctx.accounts.token_program,
      @>>  amount as u64,
    )?;

    Ok(())
}

@>>pub fn withdraw(ctx: Context<DepositWithdraw>, amount: u128) -> Result<()> {
    let token_owner_account = &ctx.accounts.token_owner_account;
    let rebate_manager = &mut ctx.accounts.rebate_manager;
    let token_vault = &ctx.accounts.token_vault;

    require!(
        token_vault.amount as u128 >= amount,
        ErrorCode::NotEnoughBalance
    );

   @>> transfer_from_vault_to_owner(
        rebate_manager,
        token_vault,
        token_owner_account,
        &ctx.accounts.token_program,
   @>>     amount as u64,
    )?;

    Ok(())
}
