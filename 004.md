# Swap fees are not correctly handled as they are substracted from the woopool_quote reserves

## Summary

The `handler()` function inside of `swap.rs` instruction makes incorrect assumptions about swap fees by firstly comparing them with reserves and then substracting from the reserves.

## Vulnerability Detail

First, `swap_fees` are calculated and substracted from the `quote_amount`:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/instructions/swap.rs#L151-152
```solidity
 let swap_fee = checked_mul_div_round_up(quote_amount, fee_rate as u128, ONE_E5_U128)?;
 quote_amount = quote_amount.checked_sub(swap_fee).unwrap();
```

Then the protocol makes the following check:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/instructions/swap.rs#L154-159
```solidity
if woopool_from.token_mint != woopool_from.quote_token_mint {
        require!(
            woopool_quote.reserve >= swap_fee && quote_token_vault.amount as u128 >= swap_fee,
            ErrorCode::NotEnoughOut
        );
    }
```
The check makes sure that the reserve in `woopool_quote` and amount in the `quote_token_vault` are greater than `swap_fee`. This is incorrect as the fees should not be compared to the balance and reserves as they are not part of the swap and just the commission that's taken upon the swap. It's then substracted from the `woopool_quote` reserves:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/instructions/swap.rs#L193-194
```solidity
  // record fee into account
    woopool_quote.sub_reserve(swap_fee).unwrap();
    woopool_quote.add_unclaimed_fee(swap_fee).unwrap();

```


## Impact

Such checking can block receiving `swap_fees` if the `quote_token_vault.amount` is smaller than the fees, for example.

## Recommendation

Remove the check for reserves and amount of the quote token vault that are compared with the swap fees.
