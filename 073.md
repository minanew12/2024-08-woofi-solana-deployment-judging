# State changes are overwritten during anchor serialization when two accounts are the same

### Summary

The swap operation takes in 3 pool accounts:

1. woopool_from
2. woopool_to
3. woopool_quote

Case 1:
In Base-to-Quote Swap, woopool_from is base token pool. woopool_to, woopool_quote will be the quote token pool and both are same accounts `woopool_to == woopool_quote`.

Case 2:
In Quote-to-Base Swap, woopool_to is base token pool. woopool_from, woopool_quote will be the quote token pool and both are same accounts `woopool_from == woopool_quote`.

Case 3:
In the case of Base-to-Base all three pools will be different.

In case 1 and case 2, two of the passed-in accounts are same. Because of how anchor works, at the end of the execution, changes of only one pool will be saved. For example in case 1 when `woopool_to`, `woopool_quote` are same, at the end of the program execution, updates to either `woopool_to` or `woopool_quote` are recorded.

Anchor `#[derive(Accounts)]` macro works by creating a in-memory copy of the account data, modifying the memory and then writing back into the account data:

- For each of the account, Anchor performs required checks based on the type `Account<'info, WooConfig>`, `Program<'info, Token>`, etc.
- For `Account<'a, T>` type accounts, Anchor deserializes the `AccountInfo.data` into `T`. For e.g, if account X is passed for `Account<'a, WooPool>` then Anchor deserializes `X.data` into type `WooPool` and keeps the copy in memory.
     -  Same as `memory` copies of state variables in Solidity.
 - The deserialized in-memory copies of the accounts are passed to the instruction-handler: for example `swap` function is an instruction handler.
 - After the instruction handler finishes execution, Anchor serializes the accounts and writes into the account data.
 - The account data is persistent and hence the state changes are saved.


Consider a Solidity function which copies a `struct` state variable into memory, changes the values in memory and at the end of the function copies the memory values into the state variable. Anchor does the same thing.

This leads to a `storage overwrite` issue when two of the passed-in accounts are same. When the second struct written into account `data`, it will overwrite any changes that are present in the first struct.

The `swap` instruction handler performs the following updates to the pools:

1. Add `from_amount` to `woopool_from` reserve
2. Subtract  `to_amount` from `woopool_to` reserve
3. Subtract `swap_fee` from `woopool_quote` reserve
4. Add `swap_fee` to unclaimed fee

`woopool_quote` is serialized last hence it will overwrite any previous changes if they are same accounts.

- If `woopool_from` == `woopool_quote`:
    - Update in `1` will be overwritten by `3` and `4`.
    - `from_amount` will not be added to `woopool_from` (quote pool) reserves
- if `woopool_to` == `woopool_quote`:
    - Update in `2` will be overwritten by `3` and `4`. 
    - `to_amount` will not be deducted from the `woopool_to` (quote pool) reserves

### Root Cause

The `swap` function tries to handle all type of swaps in a single instruction allowing for cases where two writable accounts are the same leading to `storage overwrite` issues

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/instructions/swap.rs#L13-L84

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

User performs a swap: either Base to quote or quote to base. The reserves of the quote will not be updated correctly.

### Impact

- If swap sells quote:
    - `from_amount` will not be added to `woopool_from` (quote pool) reserves
- if swap sells base for quote:
    - `to_amount` will not be deducted from the `woopool_to` (quote pool) reserves
 
This leads to incorrect accounting of `quote pool` reserves variable. 

1. The reserve will be higher than the quote pool token vault balance Or
2. The reserve will be lower than the quote pool token vault balance

Additional to incorrect state, because balance is checked before transfering tokens in claim_fee, the issue might prevent admin from claiming fees. The issue might have additional implications that aren't noted here.

### PoC

In the `1_woofi_swap.ts` test file, update the `swap_from_sol_to_usdc` test to print the reserve values of the `toPool` before and after the swap.

Add the following at line 265 in `tests/1_woofi_swap.ts`:
```js

      let toPoolDataBefore = null;
      try {
        toPoolDataBefore = await program.account.wooPool.fetch(toPoolParams.woopool);
      } catch (e) {
          console.log(e);
          console.log("fetch failed");
          return;
      }
      console.log("toPool reserve before swap:" + toPoolDataBefore.reserve);
      console.log("toPool unclaimed fee before swap:" + toPoolDataBefore.unclaimedFee);
```

and Add the following at line 357 at the end of the that test (after `swap` is called`:
```js
        let toPoolDataAfter = null;
        try {
          toPoolDataAfter = await program.account.wooPool.fetch(toPoolParams.woopool);
        } catch (e) {
            console.log(e);
            console.log("fetch failed");
            return;
        }
        console.log("toPool reserve after swap:" + toPoolDataAfter.reserve);
        console.log("toPool unclaimed fee after swap:" + toPoolDataAfter.unclaimedFee);
```
The output will be:
```text
    #swap_between_sol_and_usdc
fromWallet PublicKey:Cybv9pDy9MoysaTk3gkRi3RCtW5gz1jRzZouF47TyfnB
solWalletTokenAccount:GCGi8N26WRcwBedHCFoRo8iycWwLadaNYJx1CW7PyJQ

fromWallet Balance:0

toPool reserve before swap:200000
toPool unclaimed fee before swap:0

toAmount:136775
swapFee:4231
toTokenAccount amount:136775
toTokenAccount decimals:6
toPool reserve after swap:195769
toPool unclaimed fee after swap:4231
      âœ” swap_from_sol_to_usdc (3274ms)
```

In the test, `woopool_to` == `woopool_quote` == `USDC pool`. The `reserve` of the USDC pool should be

```solidity
usdcPool.reserve = usdcPool.reserve - toAmount - swapFee = 200000 - 136775 - 4231
```

However, in the output it can be seen that, the `usdcPool.reserve` is equal to `reserve - swap_fee = 200000 - 4231 = 195769`

The deduction of `to_amount` from the `woopool_to.reserve` is not present:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/instructions/swap.rs#L190

Only the `swap_fee` deduction is preserved because it was deducted from `woopool_quote`:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/instructions/swap.rs#L193

When Anchor serialized the accounts at the end, the `woopool_to` is first written to the account data and then the `woopool_quote`. Because both are same accounts, the changes in `woopool_to` are overwritten when `woopool_quote` is serialized and written to account data.

In case of swap usdc to sol, the changes in `woopool_from` will be overwritten by the `woopool_quote`.

### Mitigation

Divide the `swap` functions into individual `sell_base`, `sell_quote`, and `sell_base_to_base` functions.
