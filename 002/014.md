# Any user will gain authority on RebateManager

### Summary

A `create_rebate_manager` transaction from the protocol can be front-run by anyone to gain authority over a `RebateManager`.

### Root Cause

- In [`create_rebate_manager.rs#L11-L12`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/rebate_manager/src/instructions/admin/create_rebate_manager.rs#L11-L12), the `authority` signer is not checked to ensure it is a trusted address.
- In [`create_rebate_manager.rs#L14-L23`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/rebate_manager/src/instructions/admin/create_rebate_manager.rs#L14-L23), the initialization of a `RebateManager` is based on "first come, first served" 
- In [`create_rebate_manager.rs#L14-L23`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/rebate_manager/src/instructions/admin/create_rebate_manager.rs#L14-L23), the `RebaseManager` PDA is derived from the `quote_token_mint` public key. We know that project will support USDT, USDC and SOL so these parameters are known.

### Internal pre-conditions

- Â `RebateManager` associated to the given token must not have been initialized

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User calls `create_rebase_instruction` before the project, with a token address that the project aims to support (USDT, USDC, SOL).

### Impact

- User gain authority over the token's rebate manager (for example USDT)
- Protocol will never be able to gain authority over this token's rebate manager

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The program should set an access control check on the `create_rebase_manager` instruction to ensure that the signer (`authority`) is trusted.
