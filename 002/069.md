# Malicious individuals can create corresponding rebate manage and rebate info accounts in advance

## Summary
Due to the fact that the seed of the rebate_manage account is quote_token_mint, only one rebate_manage account can be created with a single quote_token token.     
Malicious individuals can create a corresponding rebate_manage account before admin wants to add a new quote_token_maint, which can prevent admin from adding a new rebate_manage and losing control over the reward token   
Due to other rebates already running in the system, it is unlikely to abandon this program and redeploy it  

## Vulnerability Detail
The rebate_manager can be created by anyone, and once created, it will prevent admin from adding the corresponding quote_tokent_mint to the rebate_manager
```rust
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct CreateRebateManager<'info> {
    pub quote_token_mint: Account<'info, Mint>,

    #[account(mut)]
    pub authority: Signer<'info>,

    #[account(
        init,
        payer = authority,
        space = 8 + RebateManager::INIT_SPACE,
        seeds = [
          REBATEMANAGER_SEED.as_bytes(),
          quote_token_mint.key().as_ref()
        ],
        bump)]
    pub rebate_manager: Box<Account<'info, RebateManager>>,
    ...
}
```
## Impact
1. Admin may not be able to add a new quote_token_maint rebate manager account
2. Malicious individuals may use the project's program to release a rebate manager

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Refer to the config mode of the woofi program and set a rebate_config. Only the rebate_config admin can create a rebate manager. In this way, once the config account is fornt-run, the project team will redeploy and the impact will be greatly reduced
