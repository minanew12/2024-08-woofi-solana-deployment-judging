# swap_fee is incorrectly calculated for the quote_amount

## Summary

`swap_fee` parameter  is calculated using `quote_amount`, `fee_rate`. However, due to incorrect divisor, incorrect amount of fees would be calculated.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the current implementation of the `handler()` function in the `swap.rs`, the `swap_fee` parameter is calculated the following way:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/instructions/swap.rs#L151
```solidity
let swap_fee = checked_mul_div_round_up(quote_amount, fee_rate as u128, ONE_E5_U128)?;
```

As you can see here, divisor is set to `ONE_E5_U128` from the `constants`:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/constants.rs#L5
```solidity
pub const ONE_E5_U128: u128 = 100_000;
```

Now imagine the following scenario: 

1. We have the pool SOL / USDT where USDT is the quote token (6 decimal places)
2. After swapping SOL to the quote token, we got 200 USDT (200e6).
3. Fee is set to 2.5% - 25e3 in the current implementation:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/constants.rs#L12-14
```solidity
// unit: 0.1 bps (1e6 = 100%, 25 = 2.5 bps)
// Fee amount = total_amount * fee_rate / 100_000.
// Max fee rate supported is u16::MAX around 65.5%.
```

The issue is that the protocol assumes that `100_000` is 1e6 when in fact it's 1e5. So, when we multiply our 200 USDT amount by 25e3 and then divide by `100_000`, we get the following amount:


```solidity
200e6 * 25e3 / 100_000 = 50
```
So the fee is taken as 25% instead of set 2.5%.

## Impact

The users will pay more fees than expected due to incorrect assumption about decimal places of 100%.

## Recommendation

Change 100% value on 1_000_000 instead of 100_000.
