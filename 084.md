# Initialization functions of rebate_manager, woofi are front-runnable

## Summary
The `create_rebate_manager` , `create_rebate_info` instructions in the rebate_manager program and `create_config` instruction in the `woofi` program can be invoked by any account. They assign the caller as the authority of the `rebate_manager` , `rebate_info` and `wooconfig` account respectively, which is the administrative authority of the programs.

## Vulnerability Detail
Once the progarms get deployed, anyone can become the account authority by calling the initialization function, since there is no mechanism to restrict access to these instructions, such as validating that only
the deployer of the program or an authorised entity can perform the initialization.

## Impact
A malicious actor can take complete ownership of the administrative accounts and hence
the program.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement access control on the caller of these instructions. A common practice is to use the program’s upgrade_authority as the authorized address to call the functions, if the program has an upgrade authority. Another solution is to set a hardcoded address of the expected owner’s public key to restrict access to only that specific address.
