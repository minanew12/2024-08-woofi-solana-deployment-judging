# DOS vulnerability due to Global WooConfig Account

High

### Summary

The current implementation of `wooconfig` is global, and this includes settings for a pause functionality.

### Root Cause

[Admin sets pause to true](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/state/wooconfig.rs#L35)


### Internal pre-conditions

Wooconfig Authority set the pause functionality to true making all swaps on the platform impossible


### Impact

If the `wooconfig.pause = true`, this will make all swaps to fail. The `wooconfig` account is generated with constant seeds hence pausing it prevents most user defined functionalities


### Mitigation

Create an Individual `wooconfig` account unique to only two whitelisted tokens(base and quote) so that pausing only affects the swaps between these two tokens rather than rendering all swaps in the platform unusable or add the pause functionality in the `woopool` account.
