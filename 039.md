# Attacker can prevent WooFi admin from adding additional base tokens

### Summary

1. Anyone can create a pool for (base, quote) pair and the `authority` field of the woopool is set to the creator address.
2. There can only be one woopool PDA for a given (base, quote) pair i.e once someone creates a pool for (B, Q) its not possible to create another pool for (B, Q).
3. `swap` operation requires that all the pools involved have the same `authority` i.e same creator.

As a result, an attacker can create a woopool for e.g (WETH, USDC), the authority address will be set to the attacker. Because rest of the pools are created by the woofi team, the `authority` field will be set to the woofi admin address for those pools. Swaps cannot work with `WETH` as base and woofi team cannot create the `WETH` pool as well hence cannot add support for WETH as base token.



### Root Cause

The seeds used for creating `woopool` state PDA do not include the `authority` address thats creating the pool. The program intends to allow multiple authorities to create pools. The pools are grouped based on the authority and swap operations are only allowed between the pools of the same group.

By not including the `authority` address as the seed for woopool PDA, the program is only allowing for one woopool for a pair. As anyone can create a pool, an attacker can create one and prohibit the woofi admin from creating that pool. Swaps require same `authority` address disallowing adding support for these base tokens.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. WooFI program supports `SOL`, `USDT` as base tokens with `USDC` as the quote token. `authority` field of these pools is set woofi admin address
2. Attacker creates wooracle and then pool for `WETH, USDC` and sets the authority to their own address
3. WooFi admin can never add support for that pair.

Note the attack does not require additional integrations. The attacker can also create `USDT, USDC` pool before the woofi admin.


### Impact

Attacker can prevent WooFi from supporting additional base tokens for swaps

### PoC

### Mitigation

Include the `authority` address creating the woopool as a seed for the PDA
