# Withdraw Instruction can withdraw total amount in pool(Including unclaimed_fees)

### Summary

The admin gated `withdraw` instruction could withdraw the entire pool balance without leaving any amount left in the pool to collect the fees to be callled by the `claim_fee` instruction.

### Root Cause

In [`deposit_withdraw.rs`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/instructions/admin/deposit_withdraw.rs#L74), the variable has an underscore hence the rust compiler ignores the variable been unused.

### Internal pre-conditions

Admin calls [`withdraw`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/lib.rs#L191) instruction where `amount + woopool.unclaimed_fees > woopool.amount`. 

Admin calls [`claim_fee`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/lib.rs#L195) instruction but cannot withdraw any fees because the pool is currently empty


### Impact

These prevents the protocol from been able to appropriately withdraw it's unclaimed fees in some scenarios.

### Mitigation

Add this below
```rust
    require!( amount + woopool.unclaimed_fee >= token_vault.amount, ErrorCode::AdminWithdrawsTooMuchFromPool )
    
       transfer_from_vault_to_owner(
        woopool,
        token_vault,
        token_owner_account,
        &ctx.accounts.token_program,
        amount as u64,
    )?;
```
to the [`deposit_withdraw.rs`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/instructions/admin/deposit_withdraw.rs#L74)
