# Possible DOS of pools leading

## Summary
The wooracles/woopools can be initialized by anyone, which can lead to DOS of pools because only one oracle/pool account exist for a certain pair of `token_mint` and `quote_token_mint`.

## Vulnerability Detail
Any address may intialize an oracle and a pool for a specific `token_mint` and `quote_token_mint` pair, which will make the said pool unusable by the protocol because the authority (a malicious actor) will be able to withdraw any tokens deposited to the pool by the config’s `woopool_admin_authority` . The issue arises because the signer of the instruction gets declared as admin and there is no check that this signer is indeed the admin of the protocol.

## Impact
Protocol’s pool will be unusable, which will lead to redeployment of the program to a new account if the team wants to expand their pools to the ones that are currently compromised.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement access control, add a constraint that the signer of the instruction is the wooconfig’s `authority`.
