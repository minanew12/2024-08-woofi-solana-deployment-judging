# Attacker can DoS WooFi deployment

### Summary

Anyone can create the WooConfig account by calling the `create_config` function immediately after deployment. Any given WooFi program can only have one `WooConfig` state account and the caller of the `create_config` becomes the authority for the `WooConfig` hence controls all admin related functions of the WooFi program.


When an attacker calls the `create_config` function before the protocol team, the authority can be set to attaker controlled address making the deployment unusable.

### Root Cause

The `create_config` function should check that an admin called the function by comparing against an hardcoded address in the program. The function only ensures that an `authority` signed the instruction, there are no checks on the address of authority:

Because deployments work differently on Solana, there is no constructor for the program hence the `owner` addresses cannot be set like in Ethereum. The initializer address must be hard-coded.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The WooFi team deploys the program
2. Eve, an attacker, calls the `create_config` function.

### Impact

Attacker DoSes the deployment

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Hardcode an initializer address and ensure the initializer is signer for the `create_config` call,
