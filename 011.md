# get_price.rs - Missing Ownership Validation on Oracle Accounts

## Summary
The contract does not verify that the `price_update` and `quote_price_update` accounts used to fetch oracle price data are owned by the Pyth oracle program. 

This creates a vulnerability where an attacker could provide impersonator accounts that mimic the structure of legitimate oracle accounts but deliver manipulated price data.

## Vulnerability Detail
The contract interacts with the following accounts for price updates but lacks ownership checks:
```rust
pub struct GetPrice<'info> {
    #[account(
        has_one = wooconfig,
        has_one = price_update,
        has_one = quote_price_update,
    )]
    pub oracle: Account<'info, Wooracle>,
    -->
    pub price_update: Account<'info, PriceUpdateV2>,
    pub quote_price_update: Account<'info, PriceUpdateV2>,
}
```
## Impact
Data Manipulation: Attackers could create fake `price_update` and `quote_price_update` accounts and inject manipulated price data into the contract. 

This can lead to:
- Price manipulation: Resulting in incorrect trading, invalid liquidations, or profit from arbitrage based on false price feeds.
- Loss of funds: Incorrect actions based on manipulated prices could result in theft or misallocation of funds.
- Unfair token exchanges: Leading to users receiving incorrect amounts in trades or swaps.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate this issue, implement ownership validation on the price_update and quote_price_update accounts to ensure they belong to the Pyth oracle program. In Anchor, this can be done by adding an owner check in the account definition.

Like this:
```rust
#[account(
    owner = pyth_solana_receiver_sdk::ID // Replace with the actual Pyth program ID
)]
pub price_update: Account<'info, PriceUpdateV2>,

#[account(
    owner = pyth_solana_receiver_sdk::ID // Replace with the actual Pyth program ID
)]
pub quote_price_update: Account<'info, PriceUpdateV2>,
```
This ensures that both the `price_update` and `quote_price_update` accounts are owned by the Pyth oracle program, preventing the use of manipulated accounts.
