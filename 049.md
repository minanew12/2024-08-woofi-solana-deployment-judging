# Missing Initialization Check in initialize Method

## Summary
The [initialize](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/rebate_manager/src/state/rebate_manager.rs#L61-L72) method in the [RebateManager](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/rebate_manager/src/state/rebate_manager.rs) contract lacks a crucial check to prevent it from being called multiple times. As such, it allows an attacker to re-initialize the contract.
## Vulnerability Detail
The current [initialize](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/rebate_manager/src/state/rebate_manager.rs#L61-L72) method doesn't verify whether the `RebateManager` has already been `initialized`. This means any user can call this method at any time to overwrite the existing configuration.
By re-calling `initialize`, an attacker can change the authority, `quote_token_mint`, and `token_vault` to values they control. This effectively hands over control of the contract and its assets to the attacker.
## Impact
The contract can be reinitialized and as such, an attacker can become the new authority, gaining full control over administrative functions.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Introduce a check at the beginning of the initialize method to ensure it can only be executed once. One common approach is to verify that a specific field is unset (e.g., authority is still `Pubkey::default()`) before proceeding.
```rust
    pub fn initialize(
        &mut self,
        authority: Pubkey,
        quote_token_mint: Pubkey,
        token_vault: Pubkey,
    ) -> Result<()> {
        require!(
            self.authority == Pubkey::default(),
            ErrorCode::AlreadyInitialized
        );

        self.authority = authority;
        self.quote_token_mint = quote_token_mint;
        self.token_vault = token_vault;

        Ok(())
    }

```
By adding this check, any attempt to `re-initialize` an already `initialized` `RebateManager` will fail.
