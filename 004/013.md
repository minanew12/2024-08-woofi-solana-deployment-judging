# An admin authority initializing RebateInfo will make claim_rebate_fee unusable

### Summary

A `ClaimRebateFee` constraint enforces that `rebate_info.authority == rebate_manager.authority`. This will always be false when an admin authority initialized the `rebate_info`, leading the `rebate_info.rebate_authority` to not be able to claim their rebate fee.

### Root Cause

In [`claim_rebate_fee.rs:26`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/rebate_manager/src/instructions/claim_rebate_fee.rs#L26), there is an incorrect constraint.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. An admin authority needs to initialize the `rebate_info` through the `create_rebate_info` instruction. It is made possible through the constraint at [`create_rebate_info.rs#L17`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/rebate_manager/src/instructions/admin/create_rebate_info.rs#L17).

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

- The rebate authority suffers from 100% rebate fee loss as it is not able to claim (through the `claim_rebate_fee` instruction).

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

This constraint should be deleted. Fixing it to check if the `rebate_info.authority` is an admin authority will lead to the same issue being triggered when admin authorities are updated.
