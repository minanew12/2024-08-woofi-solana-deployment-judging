# from_amount is not validated properly

## Summary

`from_amount` supplied by the user is not validated properly according to the docs.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the current implementation, `from_amount` is supplied by a user:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/instructions/swap.rs#L96
```solidity
pub fn handler(ctx: Context<Swap>, from_amount: u128, min_to_amount: u128) -> Result<()> {
```

However, it's not validated somehow when selling base to the quote token:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/instructions/swap.rs#L134-144
```solidity
    let mut quote_amount = from_amount;
    if woopool_from.token_mint != woopool_from.quote_token_mint {
        let state_from =
            get_price::get_state_impl(wooracle_from, price_update_from, quote_price_update)?;

        let (_quote_amount, new_base_price) = swap_math::calc_quote_amount_sell_base(
            from_amount,
            woopool_from,
            &decimals_from,
            &state_from,
        )?;

```

However, before calculating the amounts, it should check whether `base amount < balance of the base token - base token reserve` as it's done in the EVM contracts implementation:

```solidity
require(
            balance(baseToken).sub(tokenInfos[baseToken].reserve) >= baseAmount,
            'WooPPV2: BASE_BALANCE_NOT_ENOUGH'
        );

```

and in the specification:

```solidity
baseBalance = base.balanceOf(this)
baseAmount = baseBalance - baseReserve
```


## Impact

Insufficient validation of the `from_amount` can lead to incorrect amount being sent.

## Code Snippet

Provided above.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add the checks to validate `from_amount`.
