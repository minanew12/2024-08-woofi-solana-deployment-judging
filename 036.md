# Wooracle authority is incorrectly set

## Summary

At the moment wooracle admin is marked as the signer of the transaction (`msg.sender`) who calls `handler()` function without any verification if it's a trusted entity or not.

## Vulnerability Detail

`create_wooracle()` instruction is used to create a new wooracle with different parameters by calling `handler()` function:

https://github.com/woonetwork/woofi_swap_smart_contracts/blob/main/contracts/WooPPV2.sol#L84
```solidity
pub fn handler(ctx: Context<CreateWooracle>, maximum_age: u64) -> Result<()>
```

However, in the current version of the instruction, admin is currently set as just signer:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/instructions/admin/create_wooracle.rs#L62
```solidity
 admin: Signer<'info>,
```

And there is no any constraint to validate if it's a trusted entity or not as it's done in other instructions meaning the `handler()` can be called by anybody.

From the spec:

```solidity
Functions need admin authority: claim_fee claim_rebate_fee create_oracle create_pool create_rebate_pool deposit set_pool_admin set_pool_state (all handlers in this file) set_woo_admin set_woo_state(all handlers in this file)
```


## Impact

Anybody can call `handler()` function and create a new wooracle that's supposed to be only called by admin.

## Recommendation

Introduce some constraints in `CreateWooracle` struct to check for the trusted authority.
