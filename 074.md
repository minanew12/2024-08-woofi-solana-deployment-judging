# Potential Overflow in Decimals::new Functionb

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

The pow function can overflow if price, quote, or base are too large (e.g., greater than 19), since 10^20 exceeds the maximum value of a u64. This lack of overflow checking can cause runtime panics or incorrect calculations.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Before performing exponentiation, an overflow check should be added to ensure that price, quote, and base do not result in an excessively large exponent. You can add a check to ensure that these values are less than 20.
