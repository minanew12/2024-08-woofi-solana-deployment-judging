# Attacker can control Oracles and Pools by front-running their creation

### Summary

Anyone can create Oracles and since the signer is not included in the Oracle's [seeds](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/instructions/admin/create_wooracle.rs#L51-L57), Oracles that use the same base token and feeds will be the same across different signers. 

An attacker can front-run Oracle creation with them as the `authority` for any token pair like SOL/USDT. Once the attacker controls the Oracle, they can also create its accompanying SOL/USDT Pool. This gives the attacker control over the prices of swaps and steal from users.

### Root Cause

In [`create_wooracle:51-57`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/instructions/admin/create_wooracle.rs#L51-L57), the signer is not included in the seeds. This leads to only 1 Pool per base token (it should be per token pair and this is covered in a separate report) and vulnerability to front-running. 

```rust
  #[account(
      init,
      payer = admin,
      space = 8 + Wooracle::INIT_SPACE,
      seeds = [
          WOORACLE_SEED.as_bytes(),
          wooconfig.key().as_ref(),
          token_mint.key().as_ref(),
          feed_account.key().as_ref(),
          price_update.key().as_ref()
          ],
      bump,
  )]
  wooracle: Account<'info, Wooracle>,
```

### Attack Path

1. An attacker front-runs the creation of an Oracle of the target pair SOL/USDC by invoking [`create_wooracle()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/lib.rs#L54-L56) making sure to use the official Pyth price feed and price update accounts for SOL/USD. 
2. Now that the attacker has created the SOL/USDC Oracle, no other user can create an Oracle using the same base token, price feed, and price update accounts. The attacker controls the "canonical" Oracle for SOL/USDC.
3. The attacker [creates](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/lib.rs#L123-L125) a pool paired to their SOL/USDC Oracle which sets them as the authority. 
4. The attacker now controls the price, spread, coefficient, and other parameters of the Pool and Oracle of SOL/USDC. All swaps involving SOL/USDC will be vulnerable to loss of funds with the attacker manipulating those [parameters](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/instructions/admin/set_woo_state.rs#L45-L56).

Note that [Oracle admins](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/instructions/admin/set_woo_state.rs#L11-L12) set by the protocol team can also set price, spread, and coefficient. However, the attacker can front-run user swaps when manipulating parameters to steal funds.

The attacker will lose all revenue in the Pools the attacker controls. Even when the attacker does not steal from users, they steal revenue meant for the protocol.

### Impact

The Protocol will lose all revenue in the Pools stolen by the attacker. Users can experience a permanent loss of funds when doing swaps in the attacker-controlled pools. Note that the attacker can control all supported pools/oracles.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider adding the signer to the [seeds](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/instructions/admin/create_wooracle.rs#L51-L57) of the Oracle. That way, different signers will create different Oracles.
