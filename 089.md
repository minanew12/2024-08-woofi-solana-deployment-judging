# Potential Loss of Precision in Swap Amount Conversion

## Summary

The swap function in `swap.rs` converts the `to_amount` from u128 to u64, which could lead to a loss of precision or overflow for large swap amounts.

## Description

In the swap function, the `to_amount` is calculated as a u128 value but is then cast to u64 when passing it to the `transfer_from_vault_to_owner` function. This conversion could potentially truncate the value if it exceeds the maximum value of u64 `(18,446,744,073,709,551,615)`.


## Impact

This issue could lead to several problems:

1. For very large swap amounts, the truncation could result in a significant loss of funds for the user.

2. It may cause unexpected behavior in the protocol, as the actual transferred amount might be less than what was calculated and expected.

3. It could potentially be exploited by malicious actors to manipulate swap outcomes in their favor.


**Code snippet**

```rust
    transfer_from_vault_to_owner(
    woopool_to,
    token_vault_to,
    token_to_account,
    &ctx.accounts.token_program,
    to_amount as u64,
)?;
```



## Recommendation

Implement a check to ensure that the `to_amount` does not exceed the maximum value of u64 before the conversion.

Add explicit error handling for cases where the amount exceeds u64 capacity.
Example implementation:

```rust
    if to_amount > u64::MAX as u128 {
    return Err(ErrorCode::AmountExceedsU64Max.into());
    }

    transfer_from_vault_to_owner(
        woopool_to,
        token_vault_to,
        token_to_account,
        &ctx.accounts.token_program,
        to_amount as u64,
    )?;

```
