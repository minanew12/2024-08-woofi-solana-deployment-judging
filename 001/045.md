# Missing signer check in `create_pool`

### Summary

According to the documentation, the `create_pool` instruction should only be callable by an admin. However, there is currently no check in place to verify whether the signer is an admin. Additionally, the seeds used to generate the WooPool PDA are `[WOOPOOL_SEED, wooconfig, token_mint, quote_token_mint]`, where `WOOPOOL_SEED` is a constant, `wooconfig` is a config singleton PDA, and the remaining two accounts are the mint addresses for the token pair. Notably, the admin field is not included in these seeds, which allows a malicious user to preemptively create a pool with the same token pair that the admin might intend to create, resulting in a potential DoS attack. 

However, this vulnerability is dependent on another issue (#1), as it can only be exploited when there is a `wooracle` where the authority is the signer, allowing for arbitrary pool creation.

### Root Cause

In https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/instructions/admin/create_pool.rs#L13-L14, there is a missing check on `authority`.

### Internal pre-conditions

This vulnerability is dependent on another issue (#1), as it can only be exploited when there is a `wooracle` where the authority is the signer, allowing for arbitrary pool creation.

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

Attacker calls `create_pool`

### Impact

DoS: Admin cannot create pool with the same token pair.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a constraint of `wooconfig.woopool_admin_authority.contains(authority.key)`
