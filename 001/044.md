# Missing signer check in `create_wooracle`

### Summary

According to the documentation, the `create_oracle` instruction (referred to as `create_wooracle` in the code) should only be callable by an admin. However, there is currently no check in place to verify whether the signer is an admin. Additionally, the seeds used to generate the wooracle PDA are `[WOORACLE_SEED, wooconfig, token_mint, feed_account, price_update]`, where `WOORACLE_SEED` is a constant, `wooconfig` is a config singleton PDA, and the remaining three accounts represent the base token mint, the corresponding Pyth feed account, and the price update address. Notably, the admin field is not included in these seeds, which allows a malicious user to preemptively create a `wooracle` with the same base token that the admin might intend to use, leading to a potential DoS attack.

### Root Cause

In https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/instructions/admin/create_wooracle.rs#L61-L62, there is a missing check on `admin`.

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

Attacker calls `create_wooracle`

### Impact

- DoS: Admin cannot create `wooracle` with the same base token.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a constraint of `wooconfig.wooracle_admin_authority.contains(admin.key)`
