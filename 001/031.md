# Attacker will initialize WooOracle before the project

### Summary

The missing access control check in `create_wooracle` instruction allows an attacker to initialize the wooracle, to gain authority over it.

### Root Cause

- In [`create_wooracle.rs#L62`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/instructions/admin/create_wooracle.rs#L62), there is no access control to ensure that the admin is trusted (is part of the wooconfig).
- In [`create_wooracle.rs#L47-L59`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/instructions/admin/create_wooracle.rs#L47-L59), the Wooracle PDA account can be initialized only once with the correct seeds.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The Wooracle PDA account with the correct seeds is not initialized

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Attacker executes `create_wooracle` instruction with the correct parameters.

### Impact

Attacker gains authority over the wooracle at [`create_wooracle.rs#L86`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-woofi-solana-deployment/blob/main/WOOFi_Solana/programs/woofi/src/instructions/admin/create_wooracle.rs#L86). This allows him to:
- initialize the corresponding pool, and become authority over it to drain funds (through `incase_token_got_stuck`).
- manipulate the oracle (through the `set_woo_price` instruction for example)
- set an unexpected `quote_feed_account` unrelated to `quote_token_mint`

Moreover, the protocol is not able to regain authority on this oracle and the derived pool.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a constraint on `admin` to ensure that it is trusted. This can be done by checking that the admin is part of the authority like this:

```rust
    #[account(mut,
        constraint =
            wooconfig.authority == admin.key() ||
            wooconfig.wooracle_admin_authority.contains(admin.key)
    )]
    admin: Signer<'info>, 
```

*Note: External `WooConfig` accounts that are not owned by the current program can be used to bypass this check. However, as the `wooconfig` key is used to in the PDA seeds of the wooracle, it does not have impact on the protocol.*
